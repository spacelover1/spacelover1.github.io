I already have a blog that I'm writing in Persian. Since I enjoy communicating in English, I've decided to keep an English blog.
I'm gonna write about my thoughts, experiences and many different stuff here.
I'd like to get feedback from you! So feel free to put a comment or send an E-mail.

So, Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
